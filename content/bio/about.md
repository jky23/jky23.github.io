Hello,

I am an Engineering Student at [Toulouse INP-ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) in Computer Science and Telecommunications.  
I did my preparatory classes at CPGE Mohamed V in Casablanca, Morocco.
I went to a special high school, a military one, the [Prytan√©e Militaire de Kadiogo](https://www.pmk-bf.net/). I got my high school diploma there as well as military training certificates.  

My work interests are Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Statistics. I am strongly interested in Research and Development in these fields.  
Beyond work, I'm a huge fan of Japanese manga and piano. I also like volley-ball and e-gaming.
