## Bio

Hello :wave:,

I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science from [University of Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/) and an Engineer :mortar_board: graduated from [Toulouse INP-ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html) in Computer Science and Telecommunications :computer:.  
I did my preparatory classes at CPGE Mohamed V in Casablanca, Morocco.
I went to a special high school, a military one :cop:, the [Prytan√©e Militaire de Kadiogo](https://www.pmk-bf.net/). I got my high school diploma there as well as military training certificates.  

My PhD activities are about classification and troubleshooting of Cloud Gaming applications  and on low latency applications more broadly. They are conducted within the research team [RESIST](https://team.inria.fr/resist/) in the [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/fr/) lab and within [Orange Innovation](https://www.orange.com/fr) through a [CIFRE contract](https://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/le-dispositif-cifre-7844).  

My work interests are Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Statistics. I am strongly interested in Research and Development in these fields.  
Beyond work, I'm a huge fan of Japanese manga :japanese_ogre: and piano :musical_keyboard:. I also like volley-ball and e-gaming :video_game:.
